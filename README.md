This is the repository for a physics summer project where we use neural networks, complex numbers, integration and several other maths and physics topics to create a scientific article. This repository includes code for programs, notes, reports as well as the finished article.

## Usage
The repository is divided into several folders containing the different sections of the project. The "lessons" folder contains the excersises used to learn the necessary content and each lesson. The "src" folder includes the code of all the programs. Moreover, the "article" folder includes the finished latex article.
